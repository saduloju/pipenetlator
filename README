SCAN System
===========

Library of C++ functions to support development of command
driven engineering software.

Organization:
------------

  Source code: scan.cc and sc*.h header files
               application programs need only access the scanlib.h
               (has prototypes for all functions)

  makefiles: provided for g++ (tested on Windows w/ MinGW, CygWin,
             on Linux and Mac OS X (Snow Leopard)

  scan_demo_prog.cc : source code for a reasonably simple program that
                      exercises the functions in Scan

Building scan.o
---------------

  scan.o requires binding to the application *.o files to create the
  executable

Example Input File:
------------------

  example_input has a few commands to exercise Scan functions to
  process various type of "tokens" on an input line.

Documentation
-------------

  The Scan_User_Guide.pdf describes the philosophy behind Scan,
  details the interface-use of all functions and discusses the
  demonstration program.
